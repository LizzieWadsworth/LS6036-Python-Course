Masters study at Kingston University\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Data Science Conversion MSc\n\nHere are key details for the **Data Science Conversion MSc** at Kingston University, especially for those interested in bioinformatics or computational biology.\n\n- **Course page**: [Data Science Conversion MSc – Kingston University](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/data-science-conversion-msc) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  \n- It is a conversion course aimed at those **without strong backgrounds in programming or statistics**.  \n- Includes a **pre-sessional bootcamp / ‘boot camp’** (≈ 2-week intensive) to bring everyone to baseline levels in programming, statistics, data modelling. \n- Duration options:\n  - Full-time: 1 year (starting September) \n  - Part-time: 2 years \n- Typical entry: 2:2 or above honours degree in any discipline. Individual applications may require additional requirements. \n- Accreditation by the British Computer Society (BCS).\n\n![British Computer Society Logo](/images/BCS_logo.webp)\n\n## Bioinformatics MSc by Research\n\nAn **MSc by Research** is a one-year, research-intensive master’s (Level 7) where most credit comes from a thesis-style project under a supervisor. It’s ideal if you want **deep research experience** before a PhD or a technical industry role.\n\nIf you're interested in staying with us to do a Bioinformatics MSc by Research, come and have a chat with us about potential projects! \n\n[Information about fees for MRes degrees can be found here.](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/research/research-degrees#research-degrees-in-the-faculty-of-health-science-social-care-and-education:~:text=Open-,Research%20degree%20funding%20and%20studentships,-We%20are%20pleased)\n\n:::\n\n## 3. Programming-led jobs outside core bioinformatics\n\n- Health Data Analyst / Health Informatician — NHS Trusts, public health bodies, charities. SQL/Python/R on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and other healthcare data. \n- Biostatistician / Statistical Programmer — Clinical Research Organizations and pharmaceutical companies (R/Python), clinical trials analysis and reporting.  \n- Data Scientist (Healthcare / Pharmaceutical / MedTech) — modelling *omics* (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics...) or real-world data.\n- Bioimage Analysis / Scientific Software Engineer — microscopy pipelines, segmentation, tracking (Python/C++, image processing).   \n- Scientific Publishing / Data Curation — build tools and pipelines that improve metadata, reproducibility and peer-review workflows.\n\nAnd you are also qualified for other programming jobs outside of Life Scientists!
