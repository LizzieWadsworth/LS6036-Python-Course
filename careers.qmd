## Bioinformatics MSc by Research

An **MSc by Research** is a one-year, research-intensive master’s (Level 7) where most credit comes from a thesis-style project under a supervisor. It’s ideal if you want **deep research experience** before a PhD or a technical industry role.

If you're interested in staying with us to do a Bioinformatics MSc by Research, come and have a chat with us about potential projects!

## 3. Programming-led jobs outside core bioinformatics

- Health Data Analyst / Health Informatician — NHS Trusts, public health bodies, charities. SQL/Python/R on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and other healthcare data. 
- Biostatistician / Statistical Programmer — Clinical Research Organizations and pharmaceutical companies (R/Python), clinical trials analysis and reporting.  
- Data Scientist (Healthcare / Pharmaceutical / MedTech) — modelling *omics* (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics...) or real-world data.
- Bioimage Analysis / Scientific Software Engineer — microscopy pipelines, segmentation, tracking (Python/C++, image processing).   
- Scientific Publishing / Data Curation — build tools and pipelines that improve metadata, reproducibility and peer-review workflows.

And you are also qualified for other programming jobs outside of Life Scientists! Have a look for boot camps and graduate schemes, or do a job search using the keyword "python".
