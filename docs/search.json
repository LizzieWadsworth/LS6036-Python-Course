    "text": "We are going to use Python for this course. You can do this on campus from a University Computer, online using a free Google Colab account that you can access from any web browser, or by downloading Python and Visual Studio Code onto your own device.\nClick below to see the set up instructions for each:\n\nUniversity ComputerOnline CloudOwn Device\n\n\nTo get set up, follow the below steps. Click each step for detailed instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Launch Visual Studio Code from AppsAnywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType in AppsAnywhere to the windows bar. This will open in a web browser\nOpen the following two applications by typing the name in and clicking launch:\n\nPython\nVisual Studio Code\n\n\n\n\n\nGIF of Opening VSCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Navigate to your OneDrive folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick “Open Folder” on the loading screen\nFind your OneDrive folder. You should be able to recognise the files and folders listed, from what you have saved here in your other classes.\nCreate a new folder for this python course, and open this folder.\n\n\n\n\nGIF of Opening OneDrive folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Install the python extension\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the extensions tab\nSearch and install python\n\n\n\n\nGIF of Making a Folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Create and run a Python file\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re now ready to run some Python code!\n\nGo back to your folder\nClick the “New file” button\nGive your file a name ending .py (e.g. “Test.py” )\nAdd the following line to your file\n\n\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\n\nPress the run button\n\nAnd that’s it - you’re all set up!\n\n\n\nGIF of making a python File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you can find your file in file explorer. Always back up your work such as saving in OneDrive or emailing to yourself so that you don’t lose your progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Colab is a free tool for running python on a browser - from a file saved in your Google Drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\n\n\nYou shouldn’t need a paid account for this course. If your work becomes too large, then I suggest downloading and running Python and Visual Studio Code on your device.\n\n\n\nTo get set up, follow the instructions below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up Google Colab notebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign into Google with any Google account\nGo to Google Colab\nClick file -&gt; New Notebook in Drive\nName your file (e.g “Test.ipynb”) The file is an Ipython Notebook so ends with .ipynb instead of .py\nAdd and run the following code:\n\n\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\n\n\n\nGIF of creating a Google Colab notebook\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that’s it for setting up with Google Colab!\n\n\nIf you’re working on your own laptop or computer it’s also possible to download and run Python and Visual Studio Code. These are both free, open-source programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re working on a tablet, chromebook or your device is typically slow, I recommend looking at the Google Colab option instead\n\n\n\nInstalling Python and VSCode can be a bit fiddley - let the teaching team know if you’d like any support.\nWhy two programs? Python is the programming language, that takes our data and does our analyses. Visual Studio Code is a program we use to edit and run our python files. It’s a text editor that is specialised for coding projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Install Python\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can Install Python from this website. It should automatically detect whether you are on a Windows or a Mac PC and suggest which version to download. Click download and then follow the installation instructions.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Python website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Install Visual Studio Code\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce Python is installed, you can install Visual Studio Code from this website.\nIt should also automatically detect what type of PC you are on.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Visual Studio Code website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create or move to a folder for LS6036\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick “Open Folder” on the loading screen\nBrowse files until you can find your documents - wherever you keep your university files.\nCreate a new folder for this python course, and open this folder.\n\n\n\n\nGIF of Opening OneDrive folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Install the python extension\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we need to set up Visual Studio Code to recognise and use your version of python.\n\nClick the extensions tab\nSearch and install python\n\n\n\n\nGIF of Making a Folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Write and run a python file\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re now ready to run some Python code!\n\nGo back to your folder\nClick the “New file” button\nGive your file a name ending .py (e.g. “Test.py” )\nAdd the following line to your file\n\n\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\n\nPress the run button\n\nAnd that’s it - you’re all set up!\n\n\n\nGIF of making a python File"
