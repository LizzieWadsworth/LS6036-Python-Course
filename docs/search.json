Click each step for detailed instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Launch Visual Studio Code from AppsAnywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType in AppsAnywhere to the windows bar.

Python is the programming language, that takes our data and does our analyses. Visual Studio Code is a program we use to edit and run our python files.
