# Adding to numbers and strings 

We can add two numbers together, or two strings together, but in the examples so far we've always saved the result in a new variable. 

Why doesn't the below code change the variable value? 

```{python}
# Create variable 
a = 20
# Add to variable 
a + 100 
# Print variable at the end
print(f"Variable a is {a}")
``` 

This is because we added to our variable, but we didn't _save_ the result anywhere. 

So python **did** the calculation. But didn't save the result - we didn't tell it to replace the value of `a`. 

If we want to change the value of the variable, we can _save_ the result as `a`. This will **overwrite** the previous value. 

```{python}
a = a + 100
```

We can also use the shorthand `+=` to do the same thing: 

```{python}
a += 100
```

Check out the examples below:

## Number example 1

```{python}
# Create variable 
a = 20
# Add to variable 
a += 100 
# Print variable at the end
print(f"Variable a is {a}")
``` 

## Number example 2

```{python}
# Create variable 
a = 105
# Add to variable 
a -= 23.4 
# Print variable at the end
print(f"Variable a is {a}")
``` 

## String example 1

```{python}
# Create variable 
string1 = "Hello"
# Add to variable 
string1 += " world" 
# Print variable at the end
print(f"String 1 is {string1}")
``` 

## String example 2 

```{python}
# Create variable 
string1 = "29"
# Add to variable 
string1 += "100" 
# Print variable at the end
print(f"String 1 is {string1}")
```
