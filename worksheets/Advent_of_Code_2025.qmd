# What is Advent of Code? 

Advent of Code is an advent calendar of coding challenges that has been running since 2015, founded and maintained by software engineer Eric Wastl.

<h1><a href="https://adventofcode.com/" style="color: #00cc00; text-shadow: 0 0 1px #00cc00, 0 0 3px #00cc00;">
  Go to Advent of Code
</a></h1>

Each day - for the first 12 days of December - there will be a small coding puzzle that can be solved using any programming language. Each puzzle contains a fictional backstory that is the same for all participants, but each person receives a different piece of input data and should generate a different correct result.

You don't submit your code - just the answer to the puzzle. If you get it correct, you get a gold star. 

## Join our leaderboard

We have [our own leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2025/leaderboard/private/view/5180127) for LS6036 Bioinformatics - Decoding Life's Data. Compete against your peers and lecturers by joining the leaderboard:

_Please note: It is against the spirit of Advent of Code to use ChatGPT to solve the puzzles - they're designed to be interesting for humans to solve._

Merry Christmas!
