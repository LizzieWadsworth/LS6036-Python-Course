# Comments

One of the most important practices in programming is to use good comments.

Comments help explain what the code is doing - to another programmer, to whoever is marking your assignments, to your future self (you will forget how your own code works!).

Comments are sections of the code that are ignored by the compiler - they arenâ€™t executed like the rest of your code. In python, you can comment by:

-  ```# Starting with a '#' (this is the best way!)```
-  ```"""Wrapping text in triple quotes"""```

Try the below example: 

```{pyodide}
# Example of comments
"""
print("Hello")
print("World")
print("!")
"""

print("None of the lines above are executed.") # Another comment 
```
