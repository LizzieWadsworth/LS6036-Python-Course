# Format Strings

We can also print our variables within a string using a format string. 

This can be really useful when we want to print multiple pieces of information from our python program and need to know which is which. 

A format string is similar to a string but starts with an f: ```f"Add string here"``` 

And we can insert the value of one of our variables using _curly_ brackets ```{}``` 

See example below: 

```{pyodide}
# Store name of cat owner and number of cats in variables
name_of_cat_owner = "Eman"
number_of_cats = 243

# Print information using a format string
print(f"{name_of_cat_owner} has {number_of_cats} cats")
```

## Give it a go

See if you can make a format string to print the following:

```Escherichia coli is a Gram negative bacteria```

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: ex_1
species = "Escherichia coli"
gramtype = "Gram negative"

print(f"______")
```

::: { .hint exercise="ex_1"}
::: { .callout-note collapse="false"}
## Hint 1

Put the variable names inside of curly brackets ```{}```

:::
:::

::: { .callout-tip collapse="true" title="Show answer"}
```{python}
species = "Escherichia coli"
gramtype = "Gram negative"

print(f"{species} is a {gramtype} bacteria")
```
