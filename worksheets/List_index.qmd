# List index

You can extract items from a list using the **index** - the numerical position of the item in the list. 
As lists have a defined order, you can extract, for example, the third item in the list.

Try below, does this give you the result you're expecting?

```{pyodide}
# Extracting values from a list using indexing

numbers = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']
print("The third number is", numbers[3])
```

Python starts counting at 0, so index 3 is the number 'four' in the above example. 

This means the indexes for the above number are:

```numbers[0]``` = the first number = 'one'

```numbers[1]``` = the second number = 'two' 

```numbers[2]``` = the third number = 'three'

```numbers[3]``` = the forth number = 'four' 

```numbers[4]``` = the fifth number = 'five'

```numbers[5]``` = out of range = IndexError

Output: ```"The third number is four"```
