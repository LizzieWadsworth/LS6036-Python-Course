# Ranges

Python has a useful built-in ```range()``` function for generating ranges of values.

It's useful for generating ranges for definite iteration (that's where you know when you start your loop how many iterations you're going to do). In Python that means the for loop.

The ```range()``` function can take one, two, or three arguments:

-  ```range(stop)``` — generates numbers from 0 up to but not including stop, incrementing by 1 each step

-  ```range(start, stop)``` — generates numbers from start (inclusive) up to but not including stop, incrementing by 1 each step

-  ```range(start, stop, step)``` — generates numbers from start (inclusive) up to but not including stop, incrementing by step

You choose whichever version best fits the problem you're solving. If you have a choice, use the simplest one.

Run the code below. Can you see why these three all do the same thing?

```{pyodide}
print( range(10) )
print( range(0, 10) )
print( range(0, 10, 1) )
```

Python's ranges are lazy (it's a technical term): it means that Python is not printing out the values of those ranges because it knows you haven't actually asked to look at any of them. It knows the range but won't bother actually enumerating the values until it really needs to. This is helpful when you have big numbers; it can result in more efficient programs that don't require so much memory. 

You can print the numbers out using a for loop:

```{pyodide}
# Loop through every number in the range
for number in range(10):
    print(number)
```

## Give it a go: 

Write a program that asks for an integer ```n``` and, using ```range()```, prints the following:

1.  the sum of all integer from 1 to n

2.  the sum of all even integers from 1 to n

3.  the sum of all multiples of 3 from 1 to n

_Hint: use a different ```range()``` for each one of those._

```{python}
#| eval: true
# Example user int of 5, try using input() function
user_int = 5

# sum of all integers from 1 to n
my_sum_1_n = 0
for i in range(1, user_int+1, 1):
  my_sum_1_n = my_sum_1_n + i
# exit loop to print final result
print(f"Sum of integers from 1 to n is {my_sum_1_n}")

# sum of all even integers from 1 to n
my_sum_2_n = 0
for i in range(2, user_int+1, 2):
  my_sum_2_n = my_sum_2_n + i
print(f"Sum of even integers from 1 to n is {my_sum_2_n}")

# sum of all multiples of 3 from 1 to n
my_sum_3_n = 0
for i in range(3, user_int+1, 3):
  my_sum_3_n = my_sum_3_n + i
print(f"Sum of multiples of 3 from 1 to n is {my_sum_3_n}")
```
