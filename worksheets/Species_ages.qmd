# Lifespan activity 

The below table contains information of maximum lifespans, length of gestation periods and adult weight for a range of different species. This information comes from the [AnAge database](https://genomics.senescence.info/species/index.html).

| Common name | Species name | Maximum lifespan (years) | Gestation/egg incubation length (days) | Adult weight (g) | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Human | _Homo sapiens_ | 112.5 | 280 | 62035 | 
| House mouse | _Mus musculus_ | 4 | 19 | 20.5 |
| Bowhead whale | _Balaena mysticetus_ | 211 | 396 | 100000000 |
| Blue-footed booby | _Sula nebouxii_ | 18 | 41 | 1530 |
| Brazilian tapir | _Tapirus terrestris_ | 39.6 | 398 | 250000 |

Once you have your dictionaries and/or lists, try to write a program which does the following: 

## Task 1:

1.  Print a list of all the species 
2.  Ask the user to choose a species 
3.  Print the information for that species 

_Your program should extract the information from your dictionaries and lists_


::: { .callout-note collapse="true" title="Hint"}
You can have a dictionary with the common name as each `key` and a **list** of the remaining information as the `value`
:::


::: { .callout-note collapse="true" title="Example output"}
```{python}
#| echo: false
species_dictionary = {
    "Human" : ["Homo sapiens", 112.5, 280, 62035],
    "House mouse" : ["Mus musculus", 4, 19, 20.5],
    "Bowhead whale" : ["Balaena mysticetus", 211, 396, 100000000],
    "Blue-footed booby" : ["Sula nebouxii", 18, 41, 1530],
    "Brazilian tapir" : ["Tapirus terrestris", 39.6, 398, 250000]
}

user_choice = "Brazilian tapir"

print(f"The {user_choice} has a lifespan of {species_dictionary[user_choice][1]} years,\n gestation or egg incubation time of {species_dictionary[user_choice][2]} days\n and adult weight of {species_dictionary[user_choice][3]}")
```
:::

## Task 2:

1.  Ask the user to enter two species 
2.  For each value (lifespan/gestation/weight), compare the two species and print which species has the larger value. 

::: { .callout-note collapse="true" title="Example output"}
```{python}
#| echo: false
species_dictionary = {
    "Human" : ["Homo sapiens", 112.5, 280, 62035],
    "House mouse" : ["Mus musculus", 4, 19, 20.5],
    "Bowhead whale" : ["Balaena mysticetus", 211, 396, 100000000],
    "Blue-footed booby" : ["Sula nebouxii", 18, 41, 1530],
    "Brazilian tapir" : ["Tapirus terrestris", 39.6, 398, 250000]
}

user_choice_1 = "Brazilian tapir"
user_choice_2 = "Human"

print(f"Comparing {user_choice_1} and {user_choice_2}")

# lifespan 
if species_dictionary[user_choice_1][1] > species_dictionary[user_choice_2][1]:
    print(f"{user_choice_1} has a longer lifespan")
else:
    print(f"{user_choice_2} has a longer lifespan")

if species_dictionary[user_choice_1][2] > species_dictionary[user_choice_2][2]:
    print(f"{user_choice_1} has a longer gestation or egg incubation period")
else:
    print(f"{user_choice_2} has a longer gestation or egg incubation period")

if species_dictionary[user_choice_1][3] > species_dictionary[user_choice_2][3]:
    print(f"{user_choice_1} has a heavier adult weight")
else:
    print(f"{user_choice_2} has a heavier adult weight")
```
