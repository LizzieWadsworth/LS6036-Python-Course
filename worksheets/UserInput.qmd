# User input 

Python allows for user input, using the function ```input()```.

This means we can write a program which asks the _user_ (whoever is running the program) to input some data which we will then use in our code. 

Like with ```print()```, anything we put _inside_ the brackets  ```()``` will be printed as a message in the **output**.   

However, the code will then **stop running** until the user has entered some data and pressed the enter key on their keyboard.   

The data the user enters is then **returned** from the input function. This means we can save it in a variable. 

Try the below example: 

```{python}
#| eval: false
# Ask for user's name 
user_name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Your name is", user_name)
```

You type in your input in the output region:
