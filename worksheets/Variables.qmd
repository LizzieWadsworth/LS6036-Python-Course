# Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values. We can then use it elsewhere in our program without having to manually type it in again which can be really handy.

Try:

```{pyodide}
# Printing a variable

x = "There are water voles in the Hogsmill"

print(x)
```

This is the same as our first example, but first we stored the information in a variable called x. We then told python to print whatever x is.

Next, try:

```{pyodide}
# Printing a variable

x = "There are water voles in the Hogsmill"
x = "No there isn't"
print(x)
```

Did you get the output you expected?

Next, try:

```{pyodide}
# Printing a variable

x = "There are water voles in the Hogsmill"
y = "No there isn't"
print(x)
print(y)
```

What is different in this example? How does that change the output?
