# Defining a function

You have seen builtin functions, like `print()`, `int()`, `type()`, and functions from packages, like `matplotlib.pyplot()`. 

In Python, you can also define functions yourself. This is useful when you need to do the same thing (or something very similar) again and again.

You can define a function using the format: 

> def function_name(): 

And then add your contents *after an indent* just like you would with a loop. 

However - this does not do anything on it's own! We also need to *call it* for it to run. 

Which print statement will print first, 1 or 2? Why?

```{python}
#| eval: false
# Run this - what happens? 

# defining a function:
def our_new_function():
    # print statement inside the function
    print('1: yay! We have done a function')

# print statement outside the function
print('2: Are we still in our function?')

# call the function
our_new_function()
```
