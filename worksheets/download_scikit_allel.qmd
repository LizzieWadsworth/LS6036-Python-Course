# Download scikit allel 

For reading VCF files, we're going to use the sci-kit allel package. 

To install this, follow the instructions: 

::: {.panel-tabset group="tools-tabset"}

### University Computer 

To install the package onto the university computer - after you've set up VSCode and python - add this into a python file and run it:

```{python}
#| eval: false
import subprocess
import sys

try:
    import allel
except ImportError:
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "scikit-allel"])
    import allel
```

This should check if the package is already installed, and install if it if not. 

### Online Cloud

On Google Colab, you can install a package by using `!pip`: 

```{python}
#| eval: false
!pip install scikit-allel
```

Once this is installed, you can import the package and run your code: 

```{python}
#| eval: false
import allel
```

To upload a file, you can click the files tab and upload from your computer. 

_This is temporary storage, you'll need to reupload the file for every session_

### Own Device

To install the package on your own device, go to the terminal in VSCode and type in: 

For _Windows_ computers: 

`python -m pip install scikit-allel`

For _Mac_ computers: 

`python3 -m pip install scikit-allel`

This is the preferred way of installing packages. However, if it doesn't work, you can use the same technique as used for the "University Computer" option.
