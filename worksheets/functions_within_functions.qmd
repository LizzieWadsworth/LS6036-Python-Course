# Functions inside functions 

We can also use functions within other functions. 

This can be useful if you have a program with many different steps. 

```{python}
#| eval: false
# Function within a function example 

# function to double a number
def double_a_number(any_number):
    doubled = any_number*2
    return doubled
    print('This will never be printed - as we have already returned')

# function to get a user input and convert to an integer
def get_an_input():
    number = int(input('Please input a number'))
    return number


# this function calls both of the previous functions
def do_both():
    num = get_an_input()
    numx2 = double_a_number(num)
    print(f'{num} doubled is {numx2}')



# Now we only need to execute the do_both() function, and it's going to run both of the previous functions
do_both()
```
```{python}
#| echo: false
print("Please input a number 21")
print("21 doubled is 42")
```
