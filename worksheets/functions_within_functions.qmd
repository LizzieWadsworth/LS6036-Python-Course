# Functions inside functions 

We can also use functions within other functions. 

This can be useful if you have a program with many different steps. 

```{python, eval = FALSE}
# Function within a function example 
# importing the random package to get a random number
import random 

# function to double a number
def double_a_number(chosen_number):
    doubled_number = chosen_number*2
    return doubled_number

# function to get a user input and convert to an integer
def get_random_number(min_number, max_number):
    my_random_number = random.randint(min_number, max_number)
    return my_random_number

# Run first function to get random number between 1 and 50
num = get_random_number(0, 50)
# Run second number to double this first number
numx2 = double_a_number(num)
# Print the results
print(f'{num} doubled is {numx2}')
```
