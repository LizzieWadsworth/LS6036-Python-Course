# If, elif and else

What do we do if we have three conditions? In the below example, there are two ```if``` statements but this doesn't work quite how we want it to. 

```{python}
dog_or_cat_person = "dog"
if dog_or_cat_person == "dog": 
  print("You are a dog person")
if dog_or_cat_person == "cat": 
  print("You are a cat person")
else: 
  print("You are not a dog or a cat person")
```

In the above example, *two* of our conditions printed out. Even though the user was a dog person, the line "You are not a dog or a cat person" printed out as well. 

This is because the second time we have an ```if```, python has assumed this is **unrelated** to the first if. 
The ```else``` will execute if the second ```if``` **only** is ```False```. 

The below flow chart explains what has happened:

## Using elif

```elif```, short for else if, can be used instead so that many different conditions can be tried in sequence. 

```{python}
dog_or_cat_person = "dog"

# first if statement
if dog_or_cat_person == "dog": 
  print("You are a dog person")
  
# elif - for if the first if statement is False and this elif is True
elif dog_or_cat_person == "cat": 
  print("You are a cat person")
  
# else - for if both if and elif are false
else: 
  print("You are not a dog or a cat person")
```

This then ties together both conditions:

You can add as many ```elif``` statements as you need. 

See the below example with two elif statements: 

```{python, eval = FALSE}
dog_or_cat_or_bird_person = "bird"

# first if statement
if dog_or_cat_or_bird_person == "dog": 
  print("You are a dog person")
  
# elif - for if the first if statement is False and this elif is True
elif dog_or_cat_or_bird_person == "cat": 
  print("You are a cat person")
  
# elif - for if the previous if and elif statements are False and this elif is True
elif dog_or_cat_or_bird_person == "bird": 
  print("You are a bird person")
  
# else - for if both if and elif are false
else: 
  print("You are not a dog or a cat person")
```

We can also visualise this with a flow chart.
