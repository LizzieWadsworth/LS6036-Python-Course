# Fix the errors activity 

Below are a set of if statements - they all have errors in. Can you fix them? 

:::: {.panel-tabset}

## Fix the error 1:
```{python}
#| error: true
my_value = 0.01 
if my_value
  print(my_value, "is not 0")
else: 
  print(my_value, "is 0")
```
::: { .callout-tip collapse="true" title="Show answer"}
```{python}
my_value = 0.01 
if my_value: # : was missing at the end of if statement
  print(my_value, "is not 0")
else: 
  print(my_value, "is 0")
```
:::

## Fix the error 2:
```{python}
#| error: true

user_age = 14
age_restriction = 18

if user_age < age_restriction:
print("You are too young")
else: 
print("You are old enough")
```

::: { .callout-tip collapse="true" title="Show answer"}
```{python}
user_age = 14
age_restriction = 18

if user_age < age_restriction:
    print("You are too young") # indentation was missing (four spaces at start of line)
else: 
    print("You are old enough") # indentation was missing (four spaces at start of line)
```

## Fix the error 3:
```{python}
#| error: true
# Check if species belongs to genus
target_genus = "Trypanosoma"
my_species = "Trypanosoma brucei"

if Target_genus in my_species:
  print(f"{my_species} is part of {target_genus}")
else: 
  print(f"{my_species} is not part of {target_genus}")
```

::: { .callout-tip collapse="true" title="Show answer"}
```{python}
# Check if species belongs to genus
target_genus = "Trypanosoma"
my_species = "Trypanosoma brucei"

# python is case sensenitive 
# if your variable is target_genus (with no capital letters) then you always need to refer to is as target_genus. 
if target_genus in my_species:
  print(f"{my_species} is part of {target_genus}")
else: 
  print(f"{my_species} is not part of {target_genus}")
```
