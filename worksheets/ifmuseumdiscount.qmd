# Museum discount activity

Build this program one step at a time, checking part 1 works before moving onto part 2...

A museum needs you to write a program to decide if a visitor is entitled to a reduction in the price of the ticket. The program should start by asking what the age of the visitor is.

Your program should:

1.  Ask the user to input their age
2.  print 'Reduced' if the visitor is under 26 years old
3.  Also print 'Reduced' if the visitor is over 60 years old
4.  print 'Full price' if the visitor is not eligible for a discount

::: { .callout-note collapse="true" title="Show hint"}
The function ```input()``` will always give you a string. 
Make sure you convert this to an integer or a float before doing your if statements.
