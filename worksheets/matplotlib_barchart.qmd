# Matplotlib bar charts and histograms 

With matplotlib, we can also use: 

-  `plt.bar()` to make bar charts 
-  `plt.barh()` to make _horizontal_ bar charts 
-  `plt.hist()` to calculate and make histograms

## Bar chart example 

Bar chart of number of species in an area, using a list of species and a list of values. 

```{python}
# Import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

# Define lists 
species = ["Voles", "Frogs", "Otters", "Nematodes", "Eels"]
counts = [10, 39, 1, 22, 5]

# plot as a bar chart 
plt.bar(species, counts)

# show graph 
plt.show()
```

## Horizontal bar chart 

Same example, but oriented differently!

```{python}
# Import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

# Define lists 
species = ["Voles", "Frogs", "Otters", "Nematodes", "Eels"]
counts = [10, 39, 1, 22, 5]

# plot as a bar chart 
plt.barh(species, counts)

# show graph 
plt.show()
```

## Histogram 

If we have a set of values, for example number of puppies in a litter, and we want to plot a histogram we can also do that. 

`plt.hist()` will take the values we put in an separate them into categories (0-2, 2-4, 4-6) and then count how many litters fit in each category. 

_What happens if you change the number of bins?_

```{python}
# Import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

# Define initial data
puppies_per_litter = [5, 2, 6, 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 7, 6, 5, 5, 5, 4, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4, 5, 2, 1, 8, 6]

# plot as a histogram 
plt.hist(puppies_per_litter, bins=8)

# show graph 
plt.show()
```
