# Matplotlib line graph

Matplotlib is a **library** - it has a set of tools that we can use; python code that has already been written for us! 

This short example will create a very simple line graph: 

```{python}
# Import the plotting library from matplotlib 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Make a list of x values and y values
x = [0, 1, 2]
y = [10, 5, 8]

# Plotting x values against y values 
plt.plot(x, y)

# View the created graph
plt.show()
```

## Give it a go:

-  Replace one of the x and y values with another number.
-  Change the order of numbers in the x list
-  Add an extra number to the x list and not the y list (so x has 4 values and y has 3). _What's the error here?_
-  Add more numbers to both lists
