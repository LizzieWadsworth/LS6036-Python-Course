# Matplotlib linestyle

When we use `plt.plot()` we create a line graph, and we can also change the linestyle. 

There are four options: 

-  `-`: Solid line
-  `:`: Dotted line 
-  `--`: Dashed ----------
-  `-.`: Dash dot ----------

You can apply to each line separately, see below example: 

```{python}
# Import the plotting library from matplotlib 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Make a list of x values and y values for first line
x_line1 = [0, 1, 2]
y_line1 = [10, 5, 8]

# Make a list of x values and y values for second line
x_line2 = [2, 1.5, 0.5]
y_line2 = [7, 9, 6]

# Plotting line1 with a solid line
plt.plot(x_line1, y_line1, linestyle = '-')

# Plotting line2 with a dotted line
plt.plot(x_line2, y_line2, linestyle = ':')

# View the created graph
plt.show()
```
