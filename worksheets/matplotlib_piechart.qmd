# Matplotlib Pie Charts

We can also create pie charts in matplotlib. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Simple pie chart

This is a simple pie chart - we have a list of proportions, and use `plt.pie()` to create a pie chart. 

```{python}
# import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# each size is out of 100, 
# for what proportion of the pie chart each slice takes
sizes_list = [15, 30, 45, 10] 

plt.pie(sizes_list)

plt.show()
```


##  Pie chart with labels

We can also add a list of labels using `labels=`

```{python}
# import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# labels to go with the pie chart sizes
labels_list = ["Frogs", "Hogs", "Dogs", "Logs"]
sizes_list = [15, 30, 45, 10]

plt.pie(sizes_list, labels=labels_list)

plt.show()
```

## Pie chart with explode

We've changed two things here:

1.  We've added an explode list using `explode=` - what has this done to the pie chart? 

2.  We've changed the start angle using `startangle=` - what has this done to the pie chart?

```{python}
# import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

labels_list = ["Frogs", "Hogs", "Dogs", "Logs"]
sizes_list = [15, 30, 45, 10]
# What does explode value do?
explode_list = [0, 0.1, 0, 0]

# We've also added startangle=90
plt.pie(sizes_list, explode=explode_list, labels=labels_list, startangle=90)

# What does this line do? 
plt.show()
```
