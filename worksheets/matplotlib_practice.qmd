# Matplotlib practice

Now that you've got an idea of matplotlib, try to plot the following: 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Exponential growth 

_You might have done this exercise in the while loop section_ 

_E. coli_ doubles every 20 minutes. 

Plot the growth of bacteria in an experiment: 

- Starting with 1 bacterium, and a time of 0 
- Calculate the growth over 400 minutes 
- Plot time on the x axis, and bacteria on the y axis 

::: { .callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example output"}


```{python}
#| echo: false
# Import matplotlib 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

# Set initial values 
bacteria = 1
time = 0

# Create lists to collect values 
bacteria_list = []
time_list = []

#Â Use a for loop for 400 minutes, incrementing by 20 minutes 
for i in range(0, 400, 20): 
    # double number of bacteria 
    bacteria = bacteria * 2

    # add 20 minutes to time 
    time = time + 20 

    # add values to lists
    bacteria_list.append(bacteria)
    time_list.append(time)

# Plot the data 
plt.plot(time_list, bacteria_list)
plt.show()
```

## Temperature and enzyme activity

Take the following two lists, of temperatures and corresponding enzyme activities, and plot them on a scatter graph. 

```{python}
# Temperature in degrees Celsius 
temperature = [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70]

# Simulated enzyme activity (U/mL)
enzyme_activity = [4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 48, 50, 52, 53, 54, 52, 48, 40, 30, 20, 12, 6, 3, 1]
```

::: { .callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example output"}


```{python}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
# Import matplotlib 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

# Temperature in degrees Celsius 
temperature = [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70]

# Simulated enzyme activity (U/mL)
enzyme_activity = [4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 48, 50, 52, 53, 54, 52, 48, 40, 30, 20, 12, 6, 3, 1]

plt.scatter(temperature, enzyme_activity)

plt.show()
```

## Covid and candles

In an experiment, people were:

-  Tested for an active Covid-19 infection
-  Asked to rate how strongly they could smell a scented candle 

The results can be found below: 

| Covid result | Scented candle strength | 
| --- | --- | 
| Positive | 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 3, 5, 3, 2, 1, 2 |
| Negative | 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 4, 5, 4, 3 | 

Plot the results as either: 

-  Bar chart of the average candle rating for each category 
-  Box plot of results for each category 

::: { .callout-note collapse="true" title="Example barchart"}


```{python}
#| echo: false
# Import matplotlib 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

Positives = [3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 3, 5, 3, 2, 1, 2]
Negative  = [5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 4, 5, 4, 3]

def calculate_average(listname):
    sum = 0
    for num in listname:
        sum += num
    average = sum/len(listname)
    return average

plt.bar(["Positives", "Negatives"], [calculate_average(Positives), calculate_average(Negative)])

plt.show()
```

:::

::: { .callout-tip collapse="true" title="Example boxplot"}


```{python}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
# Import matplotlib 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

Positives = [3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 3, 5, 3, 2, 1, 2]
Negative  = [5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 4, 5, 4, 3]

plt.boxplot([Positives, Negative], labels = ["Positives", "Negatives"])

plt.show()
```
