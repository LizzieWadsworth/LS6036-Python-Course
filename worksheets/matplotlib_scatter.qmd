# Matplotlib scatter 

If we want to make a scatter graph instead of a line graph, we can use `plt.scatter()`. 

The rest is the same as for the line graph!

```{python}
# Import the plotting library from matplotlib 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Make a list of x values and y values
x = [0, 1, 2]
y = [10, 5, 8]

# Plotting x values against y values 
plt.scatter(x, y)

# View the created graph
plt.show()
```
