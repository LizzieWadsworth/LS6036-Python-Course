# Premature stop codon activity 

For this activity you have a Wild Type gene sequence, and three mutants. The task is to write a program that detects whether or not the mutant has a premature stop codon. 

```{python}
# Provided Wild Type and mutant sequences
WildType = ""
mutant1 = ""
mutant2 = ""
mutant3 = ""
```

Try to break this down into small chunks: 

1.  Write a program to find the stop codon in the Wild Type sequence, and count the number of codons. The answer should be ANS. 



2.  Write a program to find the first stop codon in each of the mutant sequences, and count the number of codons. 



3.  Compare the number of codons from the Wild Type sequence to each mutant sequence, and determine whether or not the mutant has a premature stop codon.
