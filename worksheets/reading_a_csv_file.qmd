# Reading from a csv file

We've already read a file and split lines by spaces in the [Reading from a file](reading_from_a_file.qmd) section. 

Now we're going to look at a CSV file (comma separated variables). 

```{=html}
<a href="../course_files/Screen_time_and_sleep.csv" 
   class="btn btn-lg text-white rounded-pill px-4 py-2" 
   style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #89b413, #14532d); box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" 
   download>
  ðŸ“¥ Download Screen_time_and_sleep.csv
</a>
```
  \

This is esentially a table of information, stored as text separated by commas. 

The following table of information:

| Name | Screen time (hours) | Sleep (hours) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jaydev | 12 | 5 | 
| Lizzie | 14 | 10 | 
| Tharshan | 8 | 9 | 
| Sagar | 5 | 8 | 
| Saitama | 15 | 4 | 

In a csv file would look like: 

```
Name,Screen time (hours),Sleep (hours)
Jaydev,12,5 
Lizzie,14,10 
Tharshan,8,9 
Sagar,5,8 
Saitama,15,4 
```

We can read this file in python, and split every line by the comma. Instead of `.strip().split()` we can specify that we want to split on a comma (instead of a space) by using  `.strip().split(",")`

```{python}
#| eval: false
# Use with to open the file
with open("Screen_time_and_sleep.csv") as f: 
    # read the lines using readlines() and save to a list
    lines = f.readlines()

# loop through every line in the list 
for line in lines: 
    # .strip() removes the \n character 
    # .split() splits the line into a list at each space
    items = line.strip().split(",")
    print(items)
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
# Use with to open the file
with open("../course_files/Screen_time_and_sleep.csv") as f: 
    # read the lines using readlines() and save to a list
    lines = f.readlines()

# loop through every line in the list 
for line in lines: 
    # .strip() removes the \n character 
    # .split() splits the line into a list at each space
    items = line.strip().split(",")
    print(items)
```
