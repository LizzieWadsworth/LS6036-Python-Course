# Reading a fasta file

Now let's apply this to a biological file format - a fasta file (.fa)

A fasta file is a file of sequences, where each sequence is two lines in the file. 

The first line is a header sequence (starts with `>`) The second line is the raw sequence. For example:

```
>My sequence
AATTGGCCATG
```

Download the following file, and **add that to the folder** where you have your python files: 

```{=html}
<a href="../course_files/Simple_fasta_file.fa" 
   class="btn btn-lg text-white rounded-pill px-4 py-2" 
   style="background: linear-gradient(90deg, #89b413, #14532d); box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" 
   download>
  ðŸ“¥ Download Simple_fasta_file.fa
</a>
```
  \
  
And see if you can do the following: 

1.  Read the file into python 
2.  For each sequence, calculate the proportion of the sequence that is either G or C (we call this the GC content)
3.  Print the results

This is one way to do that: 

```{python}
# Start by opening the file 
with open("../course_files/Simple_fasta_file.fa") as f:
    # read the lines to list lines 
    lines = f.readlines()

# use a for loop to loop through the lines
for line in lines:
    # remove the newline \n character
    line = line.strip()

    # Check if it is header or sequence 
    if ">" in line:
        # remove the > and save the header
        header = line.replace(">", "")
    # if not header, must be sequence
    else: 
        # save the sequence
        sequence = line

        # calculate proportion of GC
        # Add counts of G and C, divide by length of sequence
        GC_content = (sequence.count("G") + sequence.count("C")) / len(sequence)

        # print result
        print(f"{header} has a GC content of {GC_content}")

```
