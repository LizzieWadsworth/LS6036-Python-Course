# View all VCF data 

We can extract and print the information for each variant using a for loop: 

```{python}
#| eval: false
import allel # import sci-kit allel
# Read vcf file and set up 
mosq_vcf_file = allel.read_vcf("mosquito_samples.vcf.gz")

# Extract chromosomes, positions, reference and alternate alleles into separate lists
chrom = mosq_vcf_file["variants/CHROM"]
pos   = mosq_vcf_file["variants/POS"]
ref   = mosq_vcf_file["variants/REF"]
alt   = mosq_vcf_file["variants/ALT"]

# Print a tab separated heading
print("Chromosome \t Position \t Reference \t Alternate")

# Use len(chrom) to get the number of variants, then use a range to go through each one
for i in range(len(chrom)):
    # At every position i, print the chromosome, position, reference and alternate alleles
    print(chrom[i], end="\t") # end = "\t" ends on a tab instead of a newline
    print(pos[i], end="\t")
    print(ref[i], end="\t")
    print(alt[i], end="\n") # Last element ends with a newline "\n"
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
import allel # import sci-kit allel
# Read vcf file and set up 
mosq_vcf_file = allel.read_vcf("../course_files/mosquito_samples.vcf.gz" )

# Extract chromosomes, positions, reference and alternate alleles into separate lists
chrom = mosq_vcf_file["variants/CHROM"]
pos   = mosq_vcf_file["variants/POS"]
ref   = mosq_vcf_file["variants/REF"]
alt   = mosq_vcf_file["variants/ALT"]

# Print a tab separated heading
print("Chromosome \t Position \t Reference \t Alternate")

# Use len(chrom) to get the number of variants, then use a range to go through each one
for i in range(len(chrom))[:10]:
    # At every position i, print the chromosome, position, reference and alternate alleles
    print(chrom[i], end="\t\t\t") # end = "\t" ends on a tab instead of a newline
    print(pos[i], end="\t\t\t")
    print(ref[i], end="\t\t\t")
    print(alt[i], end="\n") # Last element ends with a newline "\n"
```

The chromosome and position give the exact co-ordinate of the variant. 

The reference allele is the allele in the reference genome, and the alternate alleles are any other alleles detected at each position.
