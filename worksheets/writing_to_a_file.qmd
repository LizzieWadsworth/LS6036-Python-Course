# Writing to a file 

We can also write to a file in a similar way. When we use `open()` it is read-only by default but we can use the options `"a"` or `"w"` to write to files. 

The option `"a"` will append (add to the bottom of) an existing file, and the option `"w"` will **overwrite** an existing file. 

Let's use our lists of people and their favourite colours from an earlier activity, and create a new file to store this information. 

```{python}
#| eval: false
# define lists with information
names = [ "Luffy" , "Zoro" , "Nami" , "Sanji"]
colours = ["Red", "Green", "Orange", "Yellow"]

# Create or overwrite new file "Strawhat_data.txt"

with open("Strawhat_data.txt", "w") as f: 

    # Use a for loop to loop through every index in the lists 
    for i in range(0,4): 
        # Write a line for each character
        f.write(f"{names[i]} {colours[i]}\n")
```

If you run this - you should find you now have a new file in your folder! 

What happens if: 

-  You remove the newline `\n` character 
-  You change `"w"` to `"a"`

You could also create a program that asks the user for information, and then _saves that to a file_.
